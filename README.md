# Restaurant Ordering System Overview  

This restaurant ordering system is designed to efficiently manage restaurant operations by implementing several data structures and algorithms. Below are the main features and functionalities:  

## Key Features  

1. **Customer Management**  
   - Allows for the addition, removal, and modification of customer details.  
   - Maintains a list of customers using a suitable data structure (e.g., linked list or binary search tree) for efficient access and updates.  

2. **Order Storage**  
   - Facilitates the storage and retrieval of customer orders.  
   - Orders can be linked to customer profiles, enabling easy tracking of past orders.  

3. **Shortest Delivery Time Calculation**  
   - Utilizes **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to compute the shortest delivery routes from the restaurant to customers.  
   - This feature helps in optimizing delivery times and improving customer satisfaction.  

4. **Inter-Branch Distances**  
   - Implements **Floyd's Algorithm** to calculate the shortest paths between different branches of the restaurant.  
   - This is particularly useful for chain restaurants to manage logistics and delivery across multiple locations.  

## Data Structures Used  

1. **Linked Lists**  
   - Used for managing dynamic lists of customers and orders. Linked lists allow for efficient insertion and deletion operations, which can be beneficial when handling a varying number of customers or orders.  

2. **Binary Search Trees (BST)**  
   - Employed for organizing customer data or orders in a way that allows for fast search, insertion, and deletion operations. BSTs are particularly useful when you need to frequently access or modify data based on a key (e.g., customer ID).  

3. **AVL Trees**  
   - A type of self-balancing binary search tree that ensures the tree remains balanced after insertions and deletions. This can help maintain efficient operations even as the number of customers or orders grows.  

## Algorithms Implemented  

1. **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**  
   - Used to find the shortest path in a graph, which in this context represents the delivery routes. It helps in calculating the most efficient delivery routes, reducing delivery times.  

2. **Floyd's Algorithm**  
   - A dynamic programming algorithm used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. This is useful for calculating the distances between various branches of the restaurant, aiding in logistics planning.  

## Potential Benefits  

- **Efficiency**: By using appropriate data structures and algorithms, the system can handle a large volume of customers and orders efficiently.  
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Faster delivery times and effective order management can lead to improved customer experiences.  
- **Scalability**: The use of self-balancing trees like AVL trees ensures that the system can grow without significant performance degradation.  

## Conclusion  

This restaurant ordering system is a robust implementation that combines various data structures and algorithms to enhance functionality and performance.
